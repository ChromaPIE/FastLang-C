#### This is a client optimization mod that makes language change really FAST!

FastLang built on the example mod by the GT:NH team, with a command.

Now you can use `/reloadlang` in-game to reload localization changes everywhere, including the ones loaded by TXLOADER.

Shout out to **usernameak** for the [original mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastlang).
